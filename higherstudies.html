                        For those majoring in science, a ME or MS degree is recommended after engineering. So, after earning their engineering bachelorâ€™s degree with a 60% GPA, students can pursue an MS programme abroad.

                        Students must take an English proficiency test to demonstrate their level of English proficiency as well as show up for the appropriate tests based on university preferences.
                        
                        Later, individuals must submit applications to the universities that best match their interests. Before applying to a specific university, students should research the tuition costs and other associated costs.
